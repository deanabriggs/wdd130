            <br>
            <br>Once we have all the important elements for your website, we’ll start a rough layout of how it can look and function using the content you put together.
            <br>We’ll create an outline of the information together so you can decide on the primary purpose of each page and what content will go where.
            <br>We’ll discuss placement of these different components and how they might be laid out.  We might look at some existing websites that you like for some ideas and a point of reference on structure.
       </div>

          <h5>Pictures</h5>
            <p>“A picture is worth a thousand words.”  Let’s just say that pictures are extremely impactful and one of the most important things you can contribute to make your website attractive and meaningful. Unique pictures are best.  Tastefully chosen pictures of your business products, services, people, and/or location can add to the enticement for new customers.  Other pictures also have their value.  We can use pictures that are free and available to use for your page to draw attention and provide a desired feel and look to your page.

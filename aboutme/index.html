    <h2>Deana Briggs</h2>
    <p>I love being a student of BYU-Idaho because it allows me to get an education while still working full-time. I find the material relevant and the course structure to work really well for my learning style too. I am pursuing a BS in Software Development.</p>
    <p>My husband and I have been married for 22 years and run a small business together. In my work, I spend my time handling a variety of tasks from sales, AP, AR, bookkeeping, tech-support, customer service, scheduling, ordering, database design, data analysis, licensing, and about everything else that comes with being a business owner. I believe that this additional education will benefit my business, be an example to my children, and ensure I will be able to provide for my future if our circumstances change.
    <p>We live in Roseville, CA surrounded by a lot of family. We have 7 children (3-his, 1-mine, 3-ours) that are all grown, plus 3 grandchildren.
    <p>I enjoy serving people and spending time with my family. I like to play games, do crafts, project around the house, and go on small adventures. 
    <p>I was raised in the church, though my path had a few curves in the road. I love the Lord and value being a member of His church. </p>
